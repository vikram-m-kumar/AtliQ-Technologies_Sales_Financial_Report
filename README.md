# AtliQ Technologies: Sales and Financial Reports (2019-2021)
### Project Overview
This project for AtliQ Technologies focuses on providing insightful sales and financial analytics, offering a complete view of performance metrics essential for strategic decision-making. Using Power Query and Power Pivot, I implemented ETL processes, built data models, and developed key reports to monitor customer and market performance as well as financial profitability.

# Sales Report
### 1. Customer Performance Analysis<br>
- **Objective:** Measure and compare customer performance metrics, focusing on trends and key contributors to revenue.<br>

- **Data:** Net sales data of all customers for AtliQ worldwide.<br>

- **Time Period:** Years 2019, 2020, and 2021.<br>

- **Purpose:** Identify top-performing customers, analyze revenue trends, and recognize key contributors to AtliQ's revenue growth over time.<br>


### 2. Market Performance vs Targets<br>
- **Objective:** Conduct a comprehensive comparison of market performance against predefined annual sales targets for each country where AtliQ operates.<br>

- **Identify Focus Areas:** This report highlights which markets require increased attention and strategic planning.<br>

- **Evaluate Competitor Presence:** Meeting or exceeding targets in certain regions may indicate low competitive pressure, enabling a continued focus on retention rather than aggressive growth strategies.<br>

- **Strategic Improvement:** In regions where targets are not met, the report helps identify areas for improvement. This insight supports AtliQ in refining business strategies to better capture market share and drive growth in these underperforming regions.<br>



# Financial report<br>

**Key Metrics Analyzed:**<br>
Net Sales: Total revenue generated.<br>
COGS (Cost of Goods Sold): Direct costs attributed to the production of goods sold.<br>
Gross Margin: Difference between net sales and COGS.<br>
GM% (Gross Margin Percentage): Indicator of profitability relative to sales.<br>
<br>
### 1. P&L by Year & Months<br>
- **Objective:** Develop annual and quarterly views of financial performance to monitor trends over time, providing insights into AtliQâ€™s profitability.<br>

- **Profitability Insight:** Determine whether AtliQ achieved a profit or incurred a loss for each fiscal year.<br>

- **Trend Analysis:** Track annual and quarterly trends in financial performance, highlighting areas of growth and opportunities for cost reduction.<br>

- **Year-over-Year Comparisons:** Calculate and analyze the percentage increase or decrease in key metrics between consecutive years, helping identify growth patterns or areas needing strategic adjustments.<br>


### 2. P&L by Market<br>
- **Objective:** Analyze profit and loss across different markets (countries) where AtliQ operates to assess regional profitability.<br>

- **Regional Profitability Insight:** Understand the specific profit or loss generated in each market, providing a clear picture of financial performance at a country level.<BR>

- **Strategic Resource Allocation:** Identify high-performing regions where AtliQ can continue its focus and low-performing markets that may require strategic adjustments or additional investment.<br>

- **Localized Financial Trends:** Evaluate market-specific trends to better inform decision-making for each region, aiding in effective budgeting, forecasting, and market expansion efforts.<br>
